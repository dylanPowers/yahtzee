Yahtzee
========

This was the first useful app that I ever wrote. I remember writing it over
spring break "for fun" while taking CptS 111 at WSU. I had just learned
python so I wanted to take it further and do something more interesting than
what I had been doing in class. I didn't even know about object oriented
programming then so I used a lot of dicts.

For nastalgia's sake, I've committed the file with the same date as the
file's timestamp as it was found on the drive I copied it to forever ago.

Run it with `python3 Yahtzee.py`
